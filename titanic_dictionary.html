<h2 id=3D"special-notes">SPECIAL NOTES:</h2>

<p>PClass can be a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st ~ Upper;</li>
  <li>2nd ~ Middle;</li>
  <li>3rd ~ Lower</li>
</ul>

<p>Age is in Years; - Fractional if Age less than One (1) - If the Age is
Estimated, it is in the form xx.5</p>

<p>With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
some relations were ignored. The following are the definitions used for
sibsp and parch.</p>

<p>Sibling: Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard
Titanic Spouse: Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses
and Fiances Ignored) Parent: Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard
Titanic Child: Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger
Aboard Titanic</p>

<p>Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws. Some children travelled only
with a nanny, therefore parch=3D0 for them. As well, some travelled with
very close friends or neighbors in a village, however, the definitions
do not support such relations.</p>
